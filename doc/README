About
-----

mhuxd implements the microHam keyer protocol and provides virtual serial ports.
Hamradio applications such as fldigi and cqrlog can use those serial ports
things like radio control, PTT keying etc.

These keyers should work with mhuxd:

 - CW KEYER
 - DIGI KEYER
 - micro KEYER
 - micro KEYER II
 - MK2R(+)
 - micro2R

Testers welcome!

Requirements:
-------------

Kernel modules:

- ftdi_sio to access the device.
- cuse to enable mhuxd to create virtual serial devices

These are contained in most Linux distributions.


Installation
-------------

For Debian and Debian based distributions (Ubuntu) the prefered way is to
download and install mhuxd .deb packages (dpkg -i mhuxd_...deb).

For other distributions you will need to compile the software yourself (or
extract the files from a .deb archive).
Compiling requires the development packages of libudev and libfuse.

 ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
 make
 make install

This will install the config file mhuxd.conf into /etc and the daemon
into /usr/local/sbin.
