   Mhuxd is a device router for microHam keyers. Currently it runs on the
   Linux operating system only. Supported microHam keyers are:

    - micro KEYER
    - micro KEYER II
    - DIGI KEYER
    - DIGI KEYER II
    - MK2R & MK2R+
    - CW KEYER

   Starting with version 0.50 mhuxd provides a web interface. It allows 
   to perform keyer configuration changes including Winkey configuration.
   Once mhuxd is running the web interfaces can be accessed at:

      http://localhost:5052. 

   This can be changed by the -w option.

   Similar to the microHam device router mhuxd can create virtual serial ports.
   This allows ham radio applications like CQRLOG or Fldigi to send rig commands
   or utilize the K1EL Winkey chip. These ports can be created using the web 
   interface.

 
PREREQUISITES

   - Linux Operating system
   - 'cuse' kernel module 
   - 'ftdi_sio' kernel module
   - libfuse
   - libev
   - libudev

   Mhuxd doesn't need to run as root. However it needs read/write access to 
   /dev/cuse which is typically owned by root.


INSTALLATION

    Ubuntu and related distributions (Debian, Mint):
    ------------------------------------------------

    Binary packages are available. Refer to http://mhuxd.dj5qv.de/install/ for 
    details.


    Compile from source code:
    -------------------------

    To compile mhuxd you'll need the development packages for libudev, libfuse,
    libev and pkg-config.
    (For Debian & Ubuntu that would be libev-dev, libfuse-dev, libudev-dev and 
     pkg-config).

    './configure --prefix=/usr/local/mhuxd'
    'make'
    'make install'

    This would install everything into /usr/local/mhuxd.

    If you cloned the source code from GITHUB then you also need the packages
    autoconf and automake and run ./autogen.sh first.
