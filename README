   Mhuxd is a device router for microHam keyers. Currently it runs on the
   Linux operating system only. Supported microHam keyers are:

    - micro KEYER
    - micro KEYER II
    - DIGI KEYER
    - DIGI KEYER II
    - MK2R & MK2R+
    - CW KEYER

   Starting with version 0.50 mhuxd provides a web interface. It allows 
   to perform keyer configuration changes including Winkey configuration.
   Once mhuxd is running the web interfaces can be accessed at:

      http://localhost:5052. 

   This can be changed by the -w option.

   Similar to the microHam device router mhuxd can create virtual serial ports.
   This allows ham radio applications like CQRLOG or Fldigi to send rig commands
   or utilize the K1EL Winkey chip. These ports can be created using the web 
   interface.

 
PREREQUISITES

   - Linux Operating system
   - 'cuse' kernel module 
   - 'ftdi_sio' kernel module
   - libfuse
   - libev
   - libudev

   Mhuxd doesn't need to run as root. However it needs read/write access to /dev/cuse
   which is typically owned by root.


INSTALLATION

    Ubuntu and related distributions (Debian, Mint):
    ------------------------------------------------
    On Ubuntu (and corresponding Debian based distributions like Mint) install the
    required packaged, e.g. by apt-get:

    'sudo apt-get install libudev1' (use libudev0 for Ubuntu < 13.04)
    'sudo apt-get install libfuse2'
    'sudo apt-get install libev4'

    Download the appropiate mhuxd .deb package. This can then installed by:

    'sudo dpkg -i <package file>'

    After installation mhuxd will be immediately started. Check log file 
    /var/log/mhuxd/mhuxd.log.


    Compile from source code:
    -------------------------

    To compile mhuxd you'll need the development packages for libudev, libfuse, libev
    and pkg-config.
    (For Ubuntu that would be libev-dev, libfuse-dev, libudev-dev and pkg-config).

    './configure --prefix=/usr/local/mhuxd'
    'make'
    'make install'

    This would install everything into /usr/local/mhuxd.
